Public Domain Dedication
========================

The persons who have associated their work with this project (the
"Dedicator": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils
project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less the exceptions_
listed below, in the work of authorship known as "Docutils" identified
below (the "Work") to the public domain.

The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web
site <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>.  The Work consists of the
files within the "docutils" module of the Docutils project Subversion
repository (Internet host svn.code.sf.net, filesystem path
/p/docutils), whose Internet web interface is located at
<http://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/code/>.  Files dedicated to the
public domain may be identified by the inclusion, near the beginning
of each file, of a declaration of the form::

    Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been
               placed in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large
and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors.  Dedicator
intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in
perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law,
whether vested or contingent, in the Work.  Dedicator understands that
such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all
rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods
that have not yet been invented or conceived.

  This program is part of "Dive Into Python", a free Python tutorial for
  experienced programmers.

  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the Python 2.1.1 license, available at
  http://www.python.org/2.1.1/license.html

  The license is reproduced below:

  | Copyright notice (as found in LICENSE in the original source).
  | --------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  | ==========================
  |
  | Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
  | Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a
  | language called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it
  | includes many contributions from others.  The last version released
  | from CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python
  | at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,
  | Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python
  | 1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and
  | the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the
  | BeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release
  | from BeOpen.com.
  |
  | Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left
  | CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that
  | the ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public
  | License (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software
  | Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the
  | Python license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,
  | with a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables
  | later versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.1 is a derivative work
  | of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.
  |
  | After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the
  | other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All
  | intellectual property added from this point on, starting with Python
  | 2.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software
  | Foundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software
  | Foundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about
  | the PSF.
  |
  | Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
  | direction to make these releases possible.
