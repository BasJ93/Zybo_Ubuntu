Steel Bank Common Lisp for Debian
---------------------------------

To execute an SBCL executables like "normal" programs on Debian
GNU/Linux, install the package binfmt-support and use a kernel that
has support for "miscellaneous binary formats". This is the default
for Debian Linux kernels.

Compile your program using:
	(compile-file "file1.lisp")
	(compile-file "file2.lisp")

"Link" it using cat, in the same order as you would load them:
	cat file1.fasl file2.fasl > program

Make it executable:
	chmod a+x program

And have fun:
	./program [arguments ...]
