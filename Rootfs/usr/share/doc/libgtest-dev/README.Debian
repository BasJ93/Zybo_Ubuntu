	Use of precompiled libgtest Not Recommended
	-------------------------------------------

The Google C++ Testing Framework uses conditional compilation for some
things.  Because of the C++ "One Definition Rule", gtest must be
compiled with exactly the same flags as your C++ code under test.
Because this is hard to manage, upstream no longer recommends using
precompiled libraries [1].  This release still contains a precompiled
libgtest, but it will be removed in a future upload.


	Using GTest with your project
	-----------------------------

See the upsream README for instructions on using gtest with your
project.  The sources for libgtest are installed into /usr/src/gtest.

See /usr/share/doc/libgtest-dev/examples for a complete example 
including a sample makefile.
